#Open Character Record

For awhile now, I've had the idea of creating a generic XML definition for Role Playing Game character records. But those pesky copyrights of the game producers kept getting in the way. Then came the Open Gaming License, which applied open source concepts to role playing games.

So this is the *very* initial implementation of my grand idea using the Open Gaming License games. This initial version of the Open Character Record is based upon the [Basic Fantasy Role-Playing Game, 2nd Edition](http://basicfantasy.org/download.cgi/Basic-Fantasy-RPG-Rules-r75.pdf) game rules.

You'll find a XSD file in this repository that can be used to validate the character record. There is also a html file and directory of images that were generated by XMLSpy to make it easier to understand the layout of the XSD file.

So let's consider this a preview release. It's so preview, I'm not even giving a the XSD a version number higher than 0.0.0. Once I write some unit tests, I'll increment the version number accordingly. Once I have full unit test coverage, I'll increment the version to 1.0.0.

So for now, take a look and provide some feedback.

Thanks.
